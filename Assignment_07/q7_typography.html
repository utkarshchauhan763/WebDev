      <h2>The Art of Web Typography</h2>
      
      <p class="intro-text">
        Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, and adjusting the space between pairs of letters.
      </p>

      <h3>Font Families and Weights</h3>
      
      <p class="serif-text">
        This paragraph uses a <strong>serif font family</strong>. Serif fonts have small decorative strokes at the ends of characters. They are traditionally used in print media and convey a sense of <em>formality and tradition</em>.
      </p>

      <p class="sans-serif-text">
        This paragraph uses a <strong>sans-serif font family</strong>. Sans-serif fonts lack the decorative strokes of serif fonts, making them appear more modern and clean. They are <mark>excellent for digital screens</mark> and provide better readability at smaller sizes.
      </p>

      <p class="monospace-text">
        This paragraph uses a <strong>monospace font family</strong>. Each character occupies the same horizontal space, making it ideal for displaying code and maintaining vertical alignment. This is commonly used in programming environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Text Emphasis and Styling</h3>

      <p class="styled-text">
        Text can be emphasized in various ways. <strong>Strong text</strong> indicates importance or seriousness. <em>Emphasized text</em> adds stress or indicates a different voice or mood. <mark>Highlighted text</mark> draws attention to specific portions of content, like search results or key information.
      </p>

      <h3>Line Height and Letter Spacing</h3>

      <p class="tight-spacing">
        This paragraph demonstrates tight letter-spacing and line-height. Notice how the text appears more compact and dense. This can be useful for headings or when space is limited, but it may reduce readability for longer paragraphs.
      </p>

      <p class="loose-spacing">
        This paragraph demonstrates loose letter-spacing and generous line-height. Notice how the text feels more open and breathable. This improves readability and creates a more relaxed, elegant appearance. It's particularly effective for body text in articles and blog posts.
      </p>

      <h3>Text Alignment Examples</h3>

      <p class="left-align">
        This paragraph is left-aligned, which is the default for most languages that read from left to right. It creates a clean, straight left edge and a ragged right edge, making it the most readable option for body text.
      </p>

      <p class="center-align">
        This paragraph is center-aligned. It works well for short pieces of text like headings, titles, or poetry, but can be difficult to read for longer passages.
      </p>

      <p class="right-align">
        This paragraph is right-aligned. It creates a clean right edge and is sometimes used for decorative purposes or in specific design contexts, but it's generally less readable for extended text.
      </p>

      <p class="justify-align">
        This paragraph is justified, meaning both the left and right edges are aligned. This creates a clean, formal appearance and is commonly used in newspapers and books. However, it can create uneven spacing between words if not handled carefully.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="quote">
        "Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form."
        <cite>- Robert Bringhurst</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="conclusion-text">
        Good typography enhances readability, establishes visual hierarchy, and creates a better user experience. By carefully considering font choices, sizes, spacing, and emphasis techniques, designers can create beautiful and functional text layouts that effectively communicate their message.
