    <h1>Frontend, Backend, and Full-stack Development</h1>

    <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
    <p>Frontend development focuses on the user interface and user experience — what runs in the browser. Technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and frameworks like React, Vue, Angular).</p>
    <p>Real-world example: The product listing page on an online store — layout, images, responsive grid, client-side filtering and sorting are implemented by frontend developers.</p>

    <h2>Backend Development</h2>
    <p>Backend development focuses on server-side logic, databases, authentication, business rules, and APIs. Common technologies include Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring), and databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.</p>
    <p>Real-world example: The checkout process on an online store — calculating totals, processing payments, updating inventory, and storing order records are done on the backend.</p>

    <h2>Full-stack Development</h2>
    <p>Full-stack developers work across both frontend and backend. They can build end-to-end features and understand how the entire system fits together.</p>
    <p>Real-world example: A solo founder builds a small e-commerce site: they create the storefront UI, implement the server to handle orders, and set up the database to store products and orders.</p>
