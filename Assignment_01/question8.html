    <h1>Static vs Dynamic Websites</h1>

    <h2>Static Websites</h2>
    <p>Static websites serve pre-built HTML files to clients. Content does not change per request unless the files are changed on the server. They are simple, fast, and easy to host (e.g., via GitHub Pages).</p>
    <p>Example: A brochure site for a local business with a few pages (Home, About, Contact) that rarely change.</p>

    <h2>Dynamic Websites</h2>
    <p>Dynamic websites generate responses on the server per request, often using server logic and databases. Pages can be personalized or updated frequently.</p>
    <p>Example: An e-commerce site where product availability, user carts, and recommendations are generated dynamically from a database.</p>
