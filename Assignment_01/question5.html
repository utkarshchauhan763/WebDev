    <title>Q5 - What is a Web Server</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>What is a Web Server?</h1>
    <p>A web server is software (and often the machine it runs on) that listens for HTTP requests from clients (browsers or other agents), processes those requests, and returns HTTP responses (HTML, JSON, files). It routes requests to appropriate handlers and may serve static files or invoke application logic to produce dynamic responses.</p>

    <h2>Common Web Servers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apache HTTP Server</strong> — widely used, flexible, supports modules and .htaccess configuration.</li>
      <li><strong>Nginx</strong> — high-performance, often used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, or static file server.</li>
      <li><strong>Microsoft IIS</strong> — web server for Windows environments.</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js (Express)</strong> — not a traditional web server but used to build application servers handling HTTP via frameworks like Express.</li>
      <li><strong>Caddy</strong> — modern web server with automatic HTTPS (LetsEncrypt) by default.</li>
    </ul>
