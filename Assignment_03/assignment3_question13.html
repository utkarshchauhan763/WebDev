        <h2>My First Blog</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-10-13">October 13, 2025</time>
        <p>
          Today marks the beginning of my journey into web development and blogging. 
          As I start learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've decided to document my 
          progress and share the challenges and victories along the way. This blog will 
          serve as both a learning tool and a way to connect with fellow developers. 
          I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and the skills I'll develop 
          through consistent practice and dedication.

        <h2>Things I Learned This Week</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-10-10">October 10, 2025</time>
        <p>
          This week has been incredibly productive in my web development journey. I learned 
          about semantic HTML elements and their importance in creating accessible web pages. 
          The concept of using proper heading hierarchies, meaningful alt text for images, 
          and structured data really opened my eyes to the responsibility developers have 
          towards all users. I also practiced creating forms, tables, and navigation 
          structures. Each small project builds my confidence and understanding of how 
          the web works behind the scenes.
