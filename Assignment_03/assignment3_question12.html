    <h2>Why Quotes Inspire People</h2>
    <p>
      Quotes have the remarkable ability to distill complex wisdom and life experiences into 
      powerful, memorable phrases that resonate across cultures and generations. They serve as 
      mental anchors during challenging times, providing guidance and perspective when we need 
      it most. Great quotes inspire people because they capture universal truths about human 
      nature, success, failure, love, and growth in ways that are both profound and accessible. 
      They remind us that we are not alone in our struggles and aspirations, connecting us to 
      the wisdom of those who have walked similar paths before us. In just a few words, quotes 
      can shift our perspective, motivate us to take action, and help us see possibilities 
      where we once saw obstacles.
